This game was created for the Programming Paradigms course and ranked among the top 3 projects. It stood out for meeting all requirements and being fully functional. No code was copied; we used class materials and the official Pharo documentation to develop an original solution.

This is the game created for the Programming Paradigms course. Our project was awarded as one of the top 3 best works in the class. The recognition was not so much for the small graphical interface but for meeting all the project requirements in a precise way and including all the required functionalities. It was also highly original since we did not copy any code from ChatGPT or the internet; everything was developed using the readings and materials provided during the course. Additionally, we used the official documentation from the Pharo website to guide our development, which contributed to our recognition as one of the top 3 best works in the course.
